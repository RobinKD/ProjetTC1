## How to use
Two files can be run : 

### algo_tuning.py 

You just have to change the line 

    X, y, test_X = dex.get_data("../train.csv", "../test.csv")
    
where dex.get_data function needs to have the correct path towards train and test csv files.


### algorithms.py 

Same thing,

You just have to change the line 

    X, y, test_X = dex.get_data("../train.csv", "../test.csv")
    
where dex.get_data function needs to have the correct path towards train and test csv files.

### Run
To run either one,

    python algo_tuning.py
   
or 

    python algorithms.py
